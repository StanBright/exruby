# Exruby

As you know, many Ruby developers are diving into the world of Elixir.
That's great. However, I've noticed that many people
are missing some of the utility methods that are part of the standart
Ruby library or ActiveSupport. Hence this initiative to port most, if not all,
of the Ruby and ActiveSupport methods that aren't part of Elixir's standard lib.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `exruby` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:exruby, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/exruby](https://hexdocs.pm/exruby).
